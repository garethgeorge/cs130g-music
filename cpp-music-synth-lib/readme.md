# My First Synthesizer
this is a synthesizer coded in C++. It includes my own implementation of a wav file encoder that... well... allows me to encode wav files. It implements additive synthesis and enveloping at the moment. 

This synthesizer was mainly a learning project. It has a large number of memory leaks among other things. Would not recommend using. Please see py-synth in the parent directory for the final version of my synthesizer.
